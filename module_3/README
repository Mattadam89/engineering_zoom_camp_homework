I used a python script and and deployed this in a docker container to
extract all the parquet files sequentially by month and then upload these
to my GCS bucket for analysis in biquery

python script is named homework_pipeline.py

SQL used to perform the tasks and answer the questions for the home can be found
in the homework_sql.sql file
